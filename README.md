# A simple guessing game
-The rules are explained in the game but I will explain them again here.

You have to guess a number from 1 to 9 and you have 5 chances to guess it right.

I made this game because I got the idea during the course and wanted to make it come true.

It's simple but I am proud of thinking of something and making it happen.
